                    inches (116 cc³) and four-inch (102 mm) flywheels.[8] The engine was designed for use in a regular pedal-bicycle
                    frame. Over the next two years, Harley and his childhood friend Arthur Davidson worked on their motor-bicycle
                    using the northside Milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend, Henry Melk. It was finished in
                    1903 with the help of Arthur's brother, Walter Davidson. Upon testing their power-cycle, Harley and the
                    Davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around Milwaukee without pedal assistance. They
                    quickly wrote off their first motor-bicycle as a valuable learning experiment.

                        was similar to the 1903 Milwaukee Merkel motorcycle (designed by Joseph Merkel, later of Flying Merkel

                        and marked the path to future motorcycle designs. The boys also received help with their bigger
                        engine from outboard motor pioneer Ole Evinrude, who was then building gas engines of his own design
                        for automotive use on Milwaukee's Lake Street.
